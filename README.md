# cs6320_fbapp_gae

## Live Demo
I have the app running on [google app engine](https://1-dot-cs6320-fbapp-imran.appspot.com) . 

## To Run
You would need to use java 1.7 with eclipse and google app engine plugin for eclipse.  
## WARNING
you cannot run this right away, since index.jsp points to actual fb app which is connected to my app. not only that, the app-engine.xml also points to 1-dot-cs6320-fbapp-imran.appspot.com which is mine , not yours ;)
